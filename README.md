## What are open educational recourses (OER)?
Open educational resources (OER) are teaching, learning, and research materials intentionally created and licensed to be free for the end user to own, share, and in most cases, modify it. [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources).

The vision is to enable lecturers to reuse, adopt and improve it and in such a way create impact in education.

## What is a game jam?
A gamejam is like a hackathon a gettogether of talented, motivated game developer/artists and/or enthusiasts which work together in a short time span to create a video / computer game from scratch.
Gamejams - especially when done in real life - are a really cool way to work together, motivate contributors and create something beautiful in a short and effective time span.

## What is an OER game jam?
We want to combine open source with game development to improve education and thus organise OER gamejams which focus on the development of small minigames that have an educational value.
Didactic and game experts are brought together and co-create educational games which can be used adopted or reinvented in the next jam - the jam must go on :)

## Which games have been created in the previous OER Gamejams so far?
- Edgeloard - a game to learn trigonometry without even calculating. The goal is to find a way (a set of steps) to find out the length of a desired edge (pink) or the arclength of a questioned arc.
- Math Tinder - a swiping game to estimate whether a questioned quantity is larger (swipe right) or less (swipe left) or equal (swipe up)
- Function shooter - you are in a spaceship and you can control a function gun to shoot math symbols that are approaching your spaceship. By tuning the function parameters you can control the laser beam and aim at the symbols and in such a way learn how to handle functions. The goal is to collect the shot math symbols to collect math confidence.
- corn circles - you are the commander of a corn circle production alien team and you have to evaluate whether your workers have created the right size (area) of corn circle. You learn how to sum up areas in a clever way
- math wizard - a jump and run game where can beat monsters by summing up fractions
